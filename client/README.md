Welcome to AJ's NFT Marketplace!

This web application is designed to introduce you to the world of NFT trading. This marketplace displays the top NFTs on market and allows you to explore them. Each NFT modal displays the name, current price and a brief description of the collection. You;ll have the option to add tokens you are interested in to your cart and then if you decide that you want to purchase the token you can do so. The profile page allows you to interact with your account. Whether you need to edit the information associated with it or just want to view the NFTs you have purchased via your wallet. Enjoy the marketplace and buy some NFTs.

To get started you'll need to fork and clone this repository. After you open it on your local machine you'll need to run pipenv install and pipenv shell to get all the dependencies to load and to enter the shell. Next you'll need to run cd server, initialize the database, run python seed.py to load the initial NFTs into the db and finnally run python app.py to run the server. Next you'll need to open another terminal and run npm start --prefix client to get the react app to run. Just create an account and now you're ready to go!








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
